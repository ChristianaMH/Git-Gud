# Git-Gud
Learning Git and GitHub with Noah and friends!

## Here's the Roadmap
### 1. Basics:
You're going to fix all the errors in my commits that pertain to you.
I can't seem to remember how to spell your guys' names...
Here's my working list of participants:
1. Kris Ragband 
2. Cristana Hindenburg
3. Pedros Botina 

Fix (only) your name for me. Thanks. :)

### How do I contribute to your project?
##### 1. Fork this repo
Forking this repo is like `git clone`, but It creates the "clone" in a 
*remote* location (on GitHub) that you can use as (one of) your "upstream" 
locations. 
1. Fork
2. `git clone`
3. Make changes locally
4. Commit those changes locally
5. Pull from upstream (to make sure you you are up to date with whats upstream, or
in the cloud)
6. Remedy merge conflicts locally
7. Push your changes to your forked repo.
Then comes the actual contribution to **my** project. Up to this point, you've done
everything on your own machine and your own GitHub project (the remote). 
8. Do a pull request (often called a PR)
9. This stage is where we might hop on a call or be active in chat to discuss your changes. 
Sometimes PR's are trivial, but sometimes they requre deep discussion about what direction
the project is going, what need work, what needs patches, and what features need to be added
or removed. 
10. Next I (the repo maintainer) will either deny or accept these changes. This could mean you have
to work on some stuff locally before merging your repo into mine, or maybe I (the maintainer) 
can edit your file manually on my end, and immediately remedy the conflicts and such. 
11. I'll continue this list and expand on these points once we get close to this phase. Stay tuned. 


### How do you get this file on your computer?
Well, you'll need to **fork** this repo. More on this soon. 

After you've forked your repo, "clone" it onto your local machine. 
Go ahead and run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Your username and Repo here> 
``` 
in your terminal. 
For me (and this GitHub project, this is what **I** run: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScumbagScalawag/Git-Gud
``` 
*Hint: in GitHub, hover over the code block and click "copy" on the far right. 

**You'll `git clone...` *your* repo!**

This will put a `Git-Gud` folder in the place you run `git clone...`. If you want 
this project to be located in your `/home/nmcivor/Documents/coding-programming` folder, 
navigate to that folder, and run the `git clone` command. 

This command essentially downloads the stuff on the cloud to your local computer.
It does this, while also letting your computer know that this is indeed a `git` project,
which means you can run any `git ...` command and the `.gitignore` and `.git` files 
are included in your working directory. 

I'll let you guys do the git clone thing, and figure out how you get stuff locally.
